# University Simple C Starting Code #
Developed By: Sanjay Madhav ([madhav@usc.edu](madhav@usc.edu))

This package contains the starting code for the USCC project to build out a working compiler for a C language subset called USC. 
USCC uses the LLVM framework as its code generation engine.

Thanks to Dr. Changhee Jung at Purdue University for talking through some ideas, being a second set of eyes, as well as creating the Makefiles.
